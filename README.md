# arduino-nano-keyboard-workaround


So I tried to make MIDI Keyboard using my Arduino (Nano AtMega328p) from China but library doesn't work on it.
So I wasted my time and made this, workaround using python to read serial and send keypresses (**one at time**) to pc, while arduino just sends Serial.println(wasteoftime), where
*wasteoftime=some letter, who cares*
Arduino and python source files are in folder "wasteoftime".
